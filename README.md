Battling the surge of fake news is a multi-faceted, complicated project, a part of which is to detect whether rumours that are spreading are fake or real. One way in which this can be done is to analyse the public reaction to a rumour when broadcasted. The public often have information from a lot of other sources, and their collective reaction brings in valuable information in detecting whether a rumour is real or fake.
In order to analyse public reaction, we take some tweets on a topic and analyse all the replies. We classify the replies into support, deny, query and comment and later use this to verify the statement.
We achieved a 95% accuracy on the first task using branchLSTM, and 54% accuracy on the second task using a Random forest classifier. 
We have been given tagged data for training for this task. Here is a report containing all our work and results as well as a video run through of the same:
